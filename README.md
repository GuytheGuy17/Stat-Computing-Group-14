# Stat-Computing-Group-14

Contains the projects for the Extended Statistical Computing course at the University of Edinburgh 2024/25. This is a course taken by Statistics (MSc) students. 

Project 1 took a James Joyce novel and created a small language model to predict text based upon prevelence in the reference text. 

Project 2 was focused on estimated Covid-19 disease spread in the UK. Specifically looking at the population incidence over time if a subject who has been infected and recovers are not able to be infected again. This analysis could be useful when looking at the effects of lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Project 3 entailed constructing a computationally efficient Generalised Linear Mixed Model in R.
